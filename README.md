DAVEYBAGS DCA CALCULATOR V1;

OBJECTIVES
1. FACTORS IN THAT DCA ANDERSON DOUBLES THE UNITS BOUGHT AND NOT THE BTC SPENT
2. ENTER YOUR; 
            BALANCE
            MAX_BUY_COST or MAX_BUY_PERCENTAGE (One or the other)
            DCA TRIGGER %AGES 
3. THE CALCULATOR THEN WORKS OUT HOW MUCH OF YOUR BALANCE IS NEEDED TO COVER DCA FOR X NUMBER OF PAIRS WITH THOSE SETTINGS.
4. THE CALCULATOR ALSO INCLUDES A SWING PROTECTION %AGE.
5. THIS SHOWS HOW MUCH THE PAIRS NEED TO RECOVER IN A DROP TO ENABLE SALE OF THE BAGS
6. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE 2 PAIRS WITH A SWING PROTECTION %AGE OF 10%, IF BOTH PAIRS DROPPED TO 50% AND THEN RECOVERED THEY WOULD NEED TO RECOVER TO 90% OF YOUR  INITIAL BUY PRICE IN ORDER FOR YOUR BAGS TO SELL AT THE MAX DCA AVAILABLE
7. IF THE DCA LEVEL IS IN RED FOR A PAIR NUMBER X THIS THEN ASSUMES THE SWING PROTECTION WILL BE FURTHER ADVERSE AS THE DCA WILL NOT HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED.
