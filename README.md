OBJECTIVES
1.	Factors in that DCA Andewrson doubles the units bought and not the BTC spent
2.	Enter - balance, max_buy_cost or max_buy_percentage (one or the other), DCA trigger percentages
3.	The calculator then works out what percentage of your balance is needed to cover the initial purchase and DCA for x number of pairs.
4.	The calculator also includes a swing protection %age.
5.	This shows how much the pairs need to recover following a drop to enable sale of the bags
6.	For example, if you have 2 pairs with a swing protection %age of 10%, if both pairs dropped to 50% and then recovered they would need to recover to 90% of your initial buy price in order for your bags to sell at the max DCA available
7.	If the DCA level is in red for a pair number x this then assumes the swing protection will be further adverse as the DCA will not have been triggered.
